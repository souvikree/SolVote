# 🗳️ **Decentralized Voting Platform on Solana**

Welcome to the **Decentralized Voting Platform**, a **web3 application** built on the **Solana blockchain**. This platform allows users to create, participate, and interact with decentralized polls securely and transparently.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This project leverages the power of the **Solana blockchain** to provide a decentralized solution for voting. With a focus on **security**, **transparency**, and **user experience**, the platform is designed to be scalable, fast, and user-friendly. It includes a robust frontend built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, a backend powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, and integration with **Solana** using the **Web3.js SDK**.

## 🎨 **Features**

- **Decentralized Poll Creation**: Users can create polls that are stored and managed on the **Solana blockchain**.
- **Secure Voting**: Votes are recorded on-chain, ensuring **transparency** and **immutability**.
- **Real-time Results**: Poll results are updated in real-time, providing instant feedback.
- **Wallet Integration**: Users can connect their **Solana wallets** (e.g., **Phantom**) to participate in voting.
- **Responsive Design**: The platform is fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience across devices.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

### **Frontend**

- **Next.js**: For building the frontend with server-side rendering and optimized performance.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and improve code maintainability.
- **React**: The core library for building UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Solana Wallet Adapter**: For wallet integration with popular **Solana wallets** like **Phantom**.

### **Backend**

- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing server-side code.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **Solana Web3.js**: The official JavaScript SDK for interacting with the **Solana blockchain**.
- **Anchor Framework**: To simplify the development and deployment of **Solana smart contracts**.

### **Blockchain Integration**

- **Solana Program Library (SPL)**: For writing and deploying on-chain voting programs.
- **Solana CLI**: For interacting with the **Solana blockchain** during development.

### **Database (Optional)**

- **MongoDB**: For storing off-chain data such as user profiles and poll metadata.

### **Testing & Development Tools**

- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing of frontend components.
- **Mocha/Chai**: For backend testing.
- **Anchor's Testing Framework**: For smart contract testing.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.

### **Deployment**

- **Vercel**: For deploying the **Next.js** frontend with built-in serverless functions support.
- **Solana Devnet/Testnet/Mainnet**: For deploying and testing smart contracts.

## 📦 **Dependencies**

### **Frontend Dependencies**

To install the frontend dependencies, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
npm install next react react-dom typescript tailwindcss @solana/wallet-adapter-react @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets @solana/web3.js
```

### **Backend Dependencies**

To install the backend dependencies, navigate to the `backend` directory and run:

```bash
npm install express typescript solana-web3.js anchor
```

### **Wallet Integration**

Wallet integration dependencies are typically part of the frontend installation. However, if needed separately, you can install them with:

```bash
npm install @solana/wallet-adapter-react @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets @solana/web3.js
```
